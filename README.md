# Iris-Insights
Exploratory Data Analysis on Iris Dataset
# Problem Statement:
We aim to explore the famous Iris dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. By understanding the relationships between different features (petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width) and their impact on the classification of different Iris species, we can extract meaningful insights. This project serves to demonstrate how data visualization and statistical techniques can be used to analyze datasets, detect patterns, and make informed decisions. Additionally, we will implement outlier detection and correlation analysis to enhance model accuracy.
